# Multi-Tenancy Implementation: Table-per-Tenant Approach

## Overview

This document outlines the **Table-per-Tenant** approach for implementing multi-tenancy in our e-commerce application. In this approach, a single schema is used to store data for all tenants, with tenant-specific data distinguished by an additional `TenantId` column in each table.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity**: Single schema management simplifies database operations and schema changes.
- **Resource Efficiency**: More efficient use of database resources compared to multiple schemas or databases.
- **Unified Reporting**: Easier to aggregate and report data across all tenants.

## Drawbacks

- **Data Isolation**: Requires careful design to ensure proper isolation of tenant data.
- **Performance**: Large tables may require efficient indexing and query optimization.
- **Scalability**: Can become complex as the number of tenants and data volume grows.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Table Design

1. **Add Tenant Identifier Column**:
   - Include a `TenantId` column in each table to uniquely identify the tenant associated with each row.
   - Example table definition:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Products (
         ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY,
         TenantId INT NOT NULL,
         ProductName NVARCHAR(255),
         Price DECIMAL(18, 2),
         -- Other columns
         CONSTRAINT FK_Tenant FOREIGN KEY (TenantId) REFERENCES Tenants(TenantId)
     );
     ```

2. **Indexing**:
   - Create indexes on the `TenantId` column to optimize query performance.
   - Example index creation:

     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX IX_Products_TenantId ON Products(TenantId);
     ```

### 2. Application Logic

1. **Tenant Context**:
   - Implement a way to determine the current tenant in the application, such as through subdomains, headers, or tokens.

     ```csharp
     public class TenantContext
     {
         public int CurrentTenantId { get; set; }
     }
     ```

2. **Query Filtering**:
   - Update queries and data access logic to filter by `TenantId` to ensure data isolation.

     ```csharp
     public class ProductRepository
     {
         private readonly TenantContext _tenantContext;

         public ProductRepository(TenantContext tenantContext)
         {
             _tenantContext = tenantContext;
         }

         public IEnumerable<Product> GetProducts()
         {
             using (var connection = new SqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))
             {
                 var query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE TenantId = @TenantId";
                 return connection.Query<Product>(query, new { TenantId = _tenantContext.CurrentTenantId });
             }
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. Maintenance and Performance

1. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Regularly maintain indexes and perform database optimization to manage performance as data volumes grow.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor query performance and adjust indexing strategies as needed to handle large datasets.

### 4. Best Practices

- **Consistent Filtering**: Always include the `TenantId` filter in all queries to prevent data leakage.
- **Efficient Indexing**: Review and optimize indexes regularly to maintain performance.
- **Security Measures**: Implement additional security measures and validations to ensure tenant data is properly isolated and protected.

## Summary

The Table-per-Tenant approach provides a practical solution for multi-tenancy with a single schema. It simplifies database management and improves resource efficiency while requiring careful attention to data isolation and performance optimization.
